# Learning-Cpp-CUD
This is the repo for my adventure in learning C++, CUDA, HIP, and maybe OpenACC later.  
I will try to cite my sources where I can but since this is for my own personal use I
offer no promises.  If you see something of yours here and want me to remove it just let me know and I will.

## Dependencies:
* g++ >= 9.0
* C++ >= C++17
